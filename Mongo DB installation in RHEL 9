# INSTALL MONGO DB   by using command

    dnf install mongodb-org -y 

# Start & Enable MongoDB Service

    systemctl enable mongod ;systemctl start mongod 

# Usually MongoDB opens the port only to localhost(127.0.0.1), meaning this service can be accessed by the application that is hosted on this server only. However, we need to access this service to be accessed by another server so we will change config file accordingly.
# open the file  (vim /etc/mongod.conf)
      
# change listening  address from 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0 in ( /etc/mongod.conf )

# Restart the service to make the changes effected.

     systemctl restart mongod
